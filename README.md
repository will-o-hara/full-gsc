# full-gsc

To install a Chrome bookmarklet, go to any URL in Chrome. Hit the star in the address bar to create a new bookmark. Hit 'Done' but make note of which folder the bookmark is saved in. Go to that folder (it'll either be on your bookmarks bar if that's turned on - or in the bookmark folders accessed through the 3 dot menu on the right of the address bar) and right click on the bookmark you just created and click edit. 

Change the name to something more suitable - i.e. FullGSC - and then in the URL field delete everything, then paste over the Javascript code that will make your bookmarklet work. Hit save. You can move the bookmark if you want to make it easier to get to. Just click the bookmark when you want to active the bookmarklet code.
